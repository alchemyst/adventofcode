# Advent of Code solutions

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). 

I like doing these with as little help as possible, and most of these are just the first run through.

You will need Jupyter Notebook for some of them, with numpy and scipy.

To build an environment which matches the one I was solving 2021 in, use

```python
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
